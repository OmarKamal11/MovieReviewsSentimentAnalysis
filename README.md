The code provided trains a machine learning model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. 
It first imports necessary libraries such as NLTK, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
It then reads in a dataset of movie reviews from a CSV file, applies preprocessing techniques such as lemmatization and stopword removal to the text data,
and divides the data into training and testing sets.
A pipeline is created using TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features, and LinearSVC is used as a classifier to train the model.
The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Finally, the model is used to predict the sentiment of two new movie reviews.
